Define an action adder :: IO () that reads a given number 
of integers from the keyboard, one per line and displays their sum

E.g.

> adder
How many numbers? 5
1
3
5
7
9
The total is 25

Hint start by defining a function that takes the current total and How
many numbers remain to be read as arguments 

You will also need to use the library functions read and show
